### From Zero to Deployed: A Strategic Checkpoint (v3)
** Date:** 19 July 2025

Where I Am
The project has a stable technical foundation and a reliable, portable workflow. The initial phase of proving technical capability is complete. However, the process has revealed two critical strategic gaps that must be addressed before any further development: the lack of a version control system and, more fundamentally, an undefined service offering.

The New Immediate Priority: Foundational Workflow & Strategy
The previous plan to de-risk the blog integration remains valid, but it must be executed within a sound version control workflow. Furthermore, the objective of the entire project—the website itself—needs to be clarified.

1. Establishing Version Control (Prerequisite)

The ad-hoc file backup system is an unacceptable risk. The immediate next action is to initialize a Git repository. This provides the stability, portability, and confident experimentation required for professional development.

2. Defining the Service Offering: Beyond Code

The most critical insight is the realization that my value proposition is not merely "I build websites." It is "I am a multi-disciplinary creator who can execute an entire digital project from concept to deployment."

This was crystallized by reflecting on the site's profile image. It is not just a selfie; it is a micro-case-study demonstrating a range of skills:

Creative Direction & Photography: The initial image capture.

Image Processing: The use of Procreate for masking and editing.

Technical Implementation: The CSS work to integrate the image with the circular background.

These are discrete, valuable skills that are currently unadvertised. The market often treats design and development as separate, high-value services. My ability to provide a single, integrated point of contact for both is a powerful differentiator.

The Revised Strategic Plan
The plan is now clarified with a new foundational layer focused on strategy before execution.

Immediate Action: Foundational Workflow

Initialize a Git repository and make an initial commit of the current stable site. This establishes the single source of truth.

Next Step: Define the UVP & Service Tiers

Before refining the site's design, I must first refine the services it will sell. This involves explicitly listing all capabilities: Web Design, Web Development, SEO Strategy, Content Photography, Image Processing.

This strategic work will directly inform the site's content and structure.

Future Phase 1: The De-Risking Spike (on a Branch)

On a dedicated Git branch, execute the technical spike to prove the headless WordPress integration. This will confirm the viability of the full technical architecture.

Future Phase 2: The Refinement Loop (on Main)

With a stable workflow, a clearly defined service offering, and all technical risks eliminated, I can begin the formal design and refinement process. The design will now be a direct reflection of the newly defined, holistic brand.

This revised plan ensures that the final showcase site is not just a demonstration of technical skill, but a precise and compelling argument for a unique and valuable service offering.
