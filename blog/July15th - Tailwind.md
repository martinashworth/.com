## âœ… Fixing Tailwind CSS CLI Issues in a Local Project

I ran into trouble installing Tailwind CSS locally via npm â€” specifically, the `tailwindcss` CLI binary wasnâ€™t appearing in `node_modules/.bin/`.

Google Gemini misdiagnosed the issue as a broken npm environment, but ChatGPT correctly identified the real cause: I had installed **Tailwind v4**, which no longer bundles the CLI by default.

### ðŸ”§ What worked

- Rolled back to **Tailwind CSS v3**, which includes the CLI
- Cleaned up with:
  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
  npm install -D tailwindcss@3 postcss autoprefixer
  ```
- Ran:
  ```bash
  npx tailwindcss init
  ```
- Created a minimal `src/input.css`:
  ```css
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;
  ```
- Built with:
  ```bash
  npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --minify
  ```
- Added a `watch` script to `package.json`:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "watch": "tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch"
  }
  ```
- Used **VSCodeâ€™s integrated terminal** to run the watcher in one tab and work in another

### ðŸ¤– Geminiâ€™s postmortem

Gemini acknowledged the misdiagnosis. Its troubleshooting model assumed Tailwindâ€™s internal structure hadnâ€™t changed, and it didnâ€™t check the installed version. It committed to updating its diagnostic logic to account for breaking changes in package releases.

### âœ… Lesson

This was a great example of a **versioning issue being misread as an environment issue** â€” and how helpful version-aware debugging can be.
