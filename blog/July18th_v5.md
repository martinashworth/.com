### From Zero to Deployed: A Strategic Checkpoint (v5)
**Date:** 19 July 2025

Where I Am
The project has a stable technical foundation and a reliable, portable workflow. The initial phase of proving technical capability is complete. The process of getting here has been one of intense, accelerated learning, punctuated by mandatory pauses to diagnose and resolve foundational issues. This has revealed a critical insight: these pauses should not be reactive events; they must be a scheduled, deliberate part of the development cycle.

The New Immediate Priority: Formalizing the Workflow
The previous plans remain valid, but they must be executed within a more formalized structure. The ad-hoc nature of the project so far, while effective for initial learning, carries an unacceptable risk of strategic drift and workflow instability. The immediate priority is to codify the process itself.

1. Instituting Scheduled Checkpoints (Process Refinement)

The act of "emptying my head" and taking stock is a form of strategic review. This will now be a scheduled, recurring event in the project lifecycle. This ensures that development work is constantly realigned with strategic goals and prevents the momentum of coding from overriding methodical planning.

2. Establishing Version Control (Workflow Prerequisite)

The ad-hoc file backup system is an unacceptable risk. The immediate next action is to initialize a Git repository. This provides the stability, portability, and confident experimentation required for professional development.

3. Defining the Service Offering (Strategic Prerequisite)

The most critical insight is the realization that my value proposition is not merely "I build websites." It is "I am a multi-disciplinary creator who can execute an entire digital project from concept to deployment." This is demonstrated by key elements of the current site:

The Profile Image: A micro-case-study in Creative Direction, Photography, Image Processing, and Technical Implementation.

The Color Palette: A demonstration of Aesthetic Curation, translating artistic analysis into a cohesive digital brand identity.

The Revised Strategic Plan
The plan is now framed within a more disciplined, repeatable process.

Immediate Action: Foundational Workflow

Initialize a Git repository and make an initial commit of the current stable site. This establishes the single source of truth.

Next Step: Define the UVP & Service Tiers

Before refining the site's design, I must first refine the services it will sell. This involves explicitly listing all capabilities: Web Design, Web Development, SEO Strategy, Creative Direction, Content Photography, Image Processing, and Aesthetic Curation.

This strategic work will directly inform the site's content and structure.

Future Phase 1: The De-Risking Spike (on a Branch)

On a dedicated Git branch, execute the technical spike to prove the headless WordPress integration. This will confirm the viability of the full technical architecture.

Future Phase 2: The Refinement Loop (on Main)

With a stable workflow, a clearly defined service offering, and all technical risks eliminated, I can begin the formal design and refinement process. The design will now be a direct reflection of the newly defined, holistic brand.

This revised plan ensures that the final showcase site is not just a demonstration of technical skill, but a precise and compelling argument for a unique and valuable service offering, developed within a structured and reflective process.
