### From Zero to Deployed: A Strategic Checkpoint (v4)
**Date:** 19 July 2025

Where I Am
The project has a stable technical foundation and a reliable, portable workflow. The initial phase of proving technical capability is complete. However, the process has revealed two critical strategic gaps that must be addressed before any further development: the lack of a version control system and, more fundamentally, an undefined service offering.

The New Immediate Priority: Foundational Workflow & Strategy
The previous plan to de-risk the blog integration remains valid, but it must be executed within a sound version control workflow. Furthermore, the objective of the entire project—the website itself—needs to be clarified.

1. Establishing Version Control (Prerequisite)

The ad-hoc file backup system is an unacceptable risk. The immediate next action is to initialize a Git repository. This provides the stability, portability, and confident experimentation required for professional development.

2. Defining the Service Offering: Beyond Code

The most critical insight is the realization that my value proposition is not merely "I build websites." It is "I am a multi-disciplinary creator who can execute an entire digital project from concept to deployment."

This is demonstrated by two key elements of the current site that represent a range of unadvertised, high-value skills:

The Profile Image: This is not just a selfie; it is a micro-case-study in end-to-end creative execution, demonstrating skills in Creative Direction & Photography, Image Processing (Procreate), and Technical Implementation (CSS).

The Color Palette: The site's colors are not random. They are derived from a deliberate process of artistic analysis, inspired by Picasso's Portrait of Lee Miller. This demonstrates a crucial skill: Aesthetic Curation. It shows an ability to overcome creative blocks by drawing from unconventional sources and translating complex artistic inspiration into a cohesive digital brand identity.

These are discrete, valuable skills. The market often treats design and development as separate services. My ability to provide a single, integrated point of contact for the entire creative and technical process is a powerful differentiator.

The Revised Strategic Plan
The plan is now clarified with a new foundational layer focused on strategy before execution.

Immediate Action: Foundational Workflow

Initialize a Git repository and make an initial commit of the current stable site. This establishes the single source of truth.

Next Step: Define the UVP & Service Tiers

Before refining the site's design, I must first refine the services it will sell. This involves explicitly listing all capabilities: Web Design, Web Development, SEO Strategy, Creative Direction, Content Photography, Image Processing, and Aesthetic Curation.

This strategic work will directly inform the site's content and structure.

Future Phase 1: The De-Risking Spike (on a Branch)

On a dedicated Git branch, execute the technical spike to prove the headless WordPress integration. This will confirm the viability of the full technical architecture.

Future Phase 2: The Refinement Loop (on Main)

With a stable workflow, a clearly defined service offering, and all technical risks eliminated, I can begin the formal design and refinement process. The design will now be a direct reflection of the newly defined, holistic brand.

This revised plan ensures that the final showcase site is not just a demonstration of technical skill, but a precise and compelling argument for a unique and valuable service offering.
