### From Zero to Deployed: A Strategic Checkpoint (v2)
** Date:** 19 July 2025

Where I Am
The project has reached a stable technical state. The local development environment is functional, and the deployed site is responsive. The initial goal of proving technical capability is complete. However, a review of the process has revealed a critical flaw in the workflow itself: the lack of a version control system. My current method of ad-hoc file backups is unreliable, non-portable, and a direct violation of the "Foundation First" principle.

This realization supersedes the previous strategic conflict. Before deciding what to build next, I must first establish how all future work will be reliably saved and managed.

The New Immediate Priority: Establishing Version Control
The previous dilemma was between refining the current design (Path 1) and de-risking the blog integration (Path 2). Both are now secondary. The new, immediate priority is to establish a Git repository for this project.

The Problem with the Current Workflow:

Instability: Snapshots are scattered, incomplete, and lack comments. There is no single source of truth.

Risk: There is no reliable way to roll back to a known good state if an experiment fails.

Non-Portability: Relying on iCloud Drive for synchronization is fragile and has already caused environmental issues.

The Git Solution:

Atomic Snapshots: git commit allows me to save a snapshot of the entire project at a specific point in time, with a descriptive message.

Confident Experimentation: git branch allows me to create a safe, isolated environment to work on a new feature (like the blog integration POC). If the experiment fails, the branch can be deleted without affecting the stable main branch.

True Portability: A remote repository (on GitHub, for example) provides a robust, central source of truth that can be accessed and synchronized from any machine.

The Revised Strategic Plan
The conflict between refinement and de-risking is resolved by sequencing it correctly within a version-controlled workflow.

Immediate Action: Foundational Commit

Initialize a Git repository in the project folder.

Create a .gitignore file to exclude the node_modules directory.

Make an initial commit of the current, stable version of the site. This creates the first reliable snapshot.

Next Step: The De-Risking Spike (on a Branch)

Create a new Git branch named feature/blog-poc.

On this branch, execute the spike to integrate a headless WordPress instance. All work is isolated.

Once the technical capability is proven, this branch can be merged or discarded, and the learnings are preserved.

Future Phase: The Refinement Loop (on Main)

With all major technical risks eliminated and a stable version control system in place, I can confidently begin the formal design and refinement process on the main branch.

This revised plan is the only one that aligns with all stated operating principles. It establishes a solid foundation, enables methodical progress, and ensures true portability.
